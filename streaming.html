          <h2>Live Streaming Video Production</h2>
          <p>I love to produce and stream high-quality live video productions. My experience thus far has primarily been with streaming video game tournaments, 
            but I am enthusiastic about producing more traditional live events. I specialize in the technical engineering and directing side of the live production,
            and I love it when I can put out an entertaining stream that viewers enjoy.</p>

          <h3>Tribes Ascend NATL Grand Finals</h3>
          <p>Tribes: Ascend is a fast-paced game with multiple simultaneous points of interest on the map over the course of a match. In order to capture all the action, I utilized
            two "cameramen" who streamed their in-game perspective to me, and then I watched both sources and chose the most appropriate camera to display
            according to the action. I was also able to leverage the two perspectives for picture-in-picture so that no action was ever missed.</p>

          <h3>Logos Smash Bros. Tournament</h3>
          <p>This was a live event for Super Smash Bros. Project M, requiring the capture of a Wii, as well as three commentator mics and two cameras. I performed all the audio and video mixing,
            as well as updating graphics for player names and scores. A TV was set up for participants to watch the stream when they were not playing.</p>

          <h3>Hearthstone: Deck Wars Season 1 Finals</h3>
          <p>Hearthstone is a free-to-play digital card game that has players dueling against each other with virtual cards. However, the game does not feature any sort of observer
            or spectator mode. Thus, I coordinated with the players so that they could stream their in-game perspectives to me, which I could then mix and display to the commentators.
            I was also in charge of giving instruction and cues to the players and commentators for when to start the games, as well as bring them in for interviews.</p>

          <h3>Tribes Central Podcast</h3>
          <p>This was a podcast featuring myself as host and three guests discussing the game Tribes: Ascend. I incorporated their webcams via Skype and intermixed relevant video
            according to the discussion topics. In addition to hosting, I managed the videos and graphical overlays to display to viewers over the course of the show so people
            could follow along.</p>
